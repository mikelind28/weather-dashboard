# Weather Dashboard

## Description

The Weather Dashboard application fetches weather data from OpenWeather's API, allowing users to search for a city and see the weather forecast. Each city is saved to a search history list so that users can easily navigate between their favorites. Cities can be individually deleted from the search history. 

This project was an exercise in retrieving API data using HTTP requests, routing the request through a back end server, and rendering the retrieved data to a webpage.

## Installation

The application is [deployed live via Render](https://weather-dashboard-yntg.onrender.com/). 

To download and test the application files locally, you will first need to get an API key from OpenWeather and use it as an environment variable in a .env file. 

The repository can be downloaded using:

```
git clone https://github.com/mikelind28/weather-dashboard.git
```

You'll have to install the package dependencies from the weather-dashboard directory using:

```
cd weather-dashboard
npm install
```

You can test the application using ```npm run start:dev``` from the weather-dashboard directory after you've added a .env file with an API key and base URL. 

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.
